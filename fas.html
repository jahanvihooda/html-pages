    Disk space
</h2>
<p>
    FAS computer access comes with private disk space in the form of a home network directory (F: drive for students, X: drive for faculty &amp; staff) where you can save your files. When working on FES computers, be sure to save your files in this directory and not in another location, or else your work will be lost. <br><br>Each undergraduate student is granted 1GB of disk space every year. <br><br>Each graduate student is granted 1GB of disk space for the duration of their program of study. <br><br>	Due to the possibility of computer error, we <b>strongly recommend</b> that you create backup copies of all essential files using disks, CDs or USB flash drives. The Faculty is not responsible for lost work.
