    How do I print?
</h3>
<p>
    When your document is open, select print then choose one of the printer names above. Your print job will be sent to the Print Release Station PC and will be held in a queue until it is �released� by you. Note that print jobs will automatically be deleted in three days (72 hours).<br><br>To �release� the print job go to the Print Release Station PC in 259 HNES and follow the on-screen instructions.

    Scanning
</h2>
<p>
    There are three scanners available in the FES computer labs � one in each of the PC labs in HNES 253 and 258, with the other in the GIS lab in HNES 249. All three can scan images and convert text documents into editable files using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).<br>Please note: The scanners in both the GIS lab in HNES 249 and the PC lab in HNES 258 can also scan 35mm slides.<br><br>Scanning is quite simple, but can require minute adjustments that take time to learn. You may want to do additional research on how to achieve your desired results before beginning.<br><br>To use one of the scanners, log in to the computer attached to the scanner and double click the �Scanner� icon to launch the scanning software. If you need help, open the �Scanning Instructions� icon.
