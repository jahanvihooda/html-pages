    Résumé
</h2>
<p>
    A résumé is a short description of who you are and what you’ve done and is one of the best tools for promoting yourself to prospective employers. Emphasize your strong points and accomplishments. Think of your résumé as an ad for yourself.
</p>
<h3>
    Length
</h3>
<p>
    A one-page résumé works well for recent graduates. If you have an extensive work history, two pages are reasonable. Individuals with extensive work history should limit information to what is pertinent to their current job objective. If you do go to two pages, make sure the most important information is on the first page. Your name should be included on both pages.
</p>
<h3>
    Appearance
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>An organized, concise layout determines whether a résumé is read. Direct the reader’s eye with the format. Avoid dense text as it will discourage careful reading.</li>
    <li>Use high-quality white or off-white paper.</li>
    <li>If you are submitting your résumé via email or posting it directly to a database, make sure you pay attention to instructions regarding formats. Often a particular file type (e.g. plain text, Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat) will be required.</li>
    <li>A “scanner-friendly” résumé should use popular sans serif fonts (e.g. Helvetica or Arial) in size 10-14.</li>
    <li>Make sure there are no typographical, spelling or grammatical errors.</li>
    <li>Make sure your résumé will copy and FAX well. Do a photocopy test.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Content
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Concentrate on the positive and use action verbs to describe your background.</li>
    <li>Design your résumé with a particular objective in mind.</li>
    <li>List information in descending order of importance and present information important to the objective first.</li>
    <li>Be selective about what you include.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Types of résumés
</h3>
<p>
    <em>Chronological</em><br>
    The most commonly used. It lists your work experience in reverse chronological order and emphasizes your work experience.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Functional</em><br>
    Lists your skills in order of importance with examples of work experience for each skill.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Combination</em><br>
    A combination of both a chronological and functional résumé, emphasizing both your work experience and skills.
</p>

<h2>
    Curriculum vitae
</h2>
<p>
    A curriculum vitae (CV) is similar to a résumé but is more of an academic tool than an employment tool. Résumés summarize an individual’s education and experience in a page or two and are designed to demonstrate qualifications for a specific position or career. A CV is a comprehensive biographhical statement of three pages or more emphasizing professional qualifications, accomplishments and activities.

    Cover Letters
</h1>
<p>
    While a résumé is a document targeted toward a particular type of job, a cover letter establishes personal contact with an employer and highlights your background in relation to a specific position. Cover letters bridge the gap between your résumé, your experience, and your next job. They allow you to summarize your pertinent background or elaborate on a particular experience relevant to the job. They also give you the opportunity to request an interview.
</p>
<p>
    A separate cover letter should be prepared for each position you apply for. Never use form letters. A cover letter often determines whether your résumé is carefully reviewed or quickly scanned. You want to entice potential employers to read on – do not waste this opportunity by sending something carelessly written.
</p>
<p>
    Before you compose your letter, use the job announcement and your general knowledge of the industry to make a list of the top ten skills needed to be effective in the particular position. Next, prioritize this list and narrow it to three or four skills that you can demonstrate though your background, education and experience.
</p>
<h2>
    The basic cover letter model
</h2>
<p>
    Include your name, complete address and telephone number on the face of the letter. Put the addressee’s name and title, company name and complete address on the face of the letter exactly the way you put them on the envelope. Date the letter and sign the letter.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <strong>Use a business correspondence format</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>1st paragraph</em><br>
        Address your letter to a specific person and explain where you heard about the job.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>2nd paragraph</em><br>
        Explain to the employer what skills you have to offer and mention at least two qualifications you have that are relevant to the job you are applying for.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>3rd paragraph</em><br>
        Indicate what the employer does that interests you to show that you have done research.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>4th paragraph</em><br>
        Invite the reader to contact you for an interview and indicate how you can be reached.

    Interview skills
</h1>
<p>
    An interview is your chance to shine. Making a positive first impression and demonstrating that you will be a valuable employee is key to successful job searching!
</p>
<h2>
    Interview styles
</h2>
<p>
    There are four main interview styles: directed interview, undirected interview, stress interview and behavioural interview.
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Directed interview</strong><br>
        This is the most frequently used style for the first interview. The interviewer using this style works from an outline and asks specific questions within a certain time frame. He or she usually has a predetermined checklist on which he or she notes each candidate's responses.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-directed interview (conversational)</strong><br>
        This is usually unstructured and allows the interviewee to talk about his or her choice of topics. The questions are broad and general. It is a format which allows you to take control of the interview, stressing your strengths and avoiding your weaknesses.</li>
    <li><strong>Stress interview</strong><br>
        Generally consists of actions aimed towards making you feel uncomfortable. Examples include: long periods of silence, the challenging of opinions, seeming unfriendliness or brusqueness, and the posing of questions in quick succession allowing little time for you to pause. The purpose of this interview is to determine how you handle stressful situations.</li>
    <li><strong>Behavioural interview</strong><br>
        Past behaviour is a strong predictor of future behaviour. The interviewer asks specific questions seeking information about a candidate's skills, character, and preference based on examples of past behaviour. Questions are directed toward specific experiences.</li>
</ol>
<h2>
    Interview formats
</h2>
<p>
    There are seven interview formats: information/networking, screening, hiring, series, panel, group and telephone.
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Information/networking interviews</strong><br>
        This particular interview style should be conducted with friends, relatives, acquaintances, etc. While these individuals may not have a job opening in your area of interest, they do have resources of information, advice and networks which can benefit you. These “interviews” give valuable information about particular jobs/careers as well as the skills and experience necessary for particular jobs. The goal of the information interview is not to get a job with these people – only to gather useful information.<p></p>
        <p><strong>TIP</strong>: Never ask for a job; always ask for information, advice and referrals.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Screening interview</strong><br>
        This is the first form of interview contact when there is an actual job opening. The interview is typically conducted by telephone; however, it may take place face-to-face (search firms, placement offices). The interviewer will call you to inquire about your employment status, to gain more information on qualifications and identify clues regarding matching experience/qualities for the position. A positive “screen” will bring you to the next level.<p></p>
        <p><strong>TIP</strong>: It is important to politely and directly offer the information the interviewer seeks, and refrain from volunteering additional information. Save this for the probing questions which will occur in first and second interviews.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Hiring interview (one-on-one)</strong><br>
        This is the traditional type of interview. The interview will be directed by either the personnel office (asking general questions), or department managers and middle/upper management (asking specific job-content questions) depending on the position level. The goal of the employer is a) to determine whether the candidate will fit in with the organization and the staff and b) To assess how well the candidate's qualifications match the job requirements.<p></p>
        <p><strong>TIP</strong>: Establish rapport. Also, get the interviewer to describe the position and its responsibilities early in the meeting so you can relate your skills, interests and background to what they are seeking throughout the interview.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Series interviews</strong><br>
        As the hiring/placement interview is typically face-to-face with one person, the series interview consists of meeting with several individuals within the same organization throughout the day. Following the interview, the individuals you meet with will get together to compare notes and make a collective hiring decision.<p></p>
        <p><strong>TIP</strong>: Treat each successive interview during the series as if each one were the first; after all, it is the first interview for this particular interviewer.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Panel interviews</strong><br>
        This is the most infrequent of interview styles and one of the most stressful. In a panel interview, you are interviewed by several people at the same time. Caution, when favorably answering one panelist's question, you may lose the support of another!<p></p>
        <p>
            <strong>TIP</strong>: Try to connect with each person, be sensitive to the dynamics in the team and answer one question at a time.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Group interviews</strong><br>
        This is another infrequent interview style. When you find that you are being interviewed along with several other applicants, this is a group interview. An employer uses this style to gather/uncover information (interpersonal skills, peer interaction) not revealed in the hiring/placement interview style. Employers are looking for the one who exhibits the most positive leadership abilities – one who can take charge and be a leader in the workplace.<p></p>
        <p>
            <strong>TIP</strong>: You do not get a chance to speak. You have to make your chances. Make your contribution meaningful!
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Telephone interviews</strong><br>
        Telephone interviews are sometimes offered to applicants who are unable to attend an interview in person. This might be for reasons of cost, distance etc. For example, a telephone interview may be a screening interview to determine whether an applicant will be invited to attend a face-to-face interview.<p></p>
        <p>
            <strong>TIPS</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plan ahead. If the employer calls without prior notification, ask them to call back in 15 minutes or set an appointment for a time when you can be prepared and can control your environment. Have your written material available for easy reference during the interview. This will include your application (letter, resume, and selection criteria if appropriate), key details about the organization (perhaps in summary form), possibly even important concepts and key words for responses to questions;</li>
            <li>Although the interviewer(s) cannot see you, act as though you are in their office. Dress as if it were a face-to-face interview. This will help set the mood and reinforce the significance of the event;</li>
            <li>Make appropriate arrangements before the interview to ensure you will not be disturbed. It is important to have privacy and a minimum of distractions so you can give the interviewer your undivided attention;</li>
            <li>Give short replies. Short sentences are more easily understood over the phone than long orations and allow for interaction between you and the interviewer. This helps the both of you to maintain your interest;</li>
            <li>Practice your answers to anticipated questions with a tape recorder to find out how you sound over the phone. Note whether your voice shows interest and enthusiasm, or whether it is a dull monotone that will put the interviewer to sleep;</li>
            <li>Restate the question. Don't answer a question that you haven't fully understood. This will also give you time to prepare an answer and prevent long silences on the phone. Dead space is much more noticeable on the phone than at an in-person interview. Don't do this too often, though, as the interviewer will quickly become tired of repeating himself or herself;</li>
            <li>Answer questions courteously. A note of irritation or frustration in your voice is much more noticeable over the phone, and can't be offset by positive body language. Try to sound relaxed and confident</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>
    Interview questions
</h2>
<p>
    Here are some sample questions for each interview style that may be used in any interview format:
</p>
<h3>
    Directed questions
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What are your long range and short range goals and objectives?</li>
    <li>Describe your strengths and weaknesses.</li>
    <li>What qualifications do you have that are relevant to this position?</li>
    <li>In what ways do you think you can make a contribution to our organization?</li>
    <li>How has your education prepared you for your career in XYZ?</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>TIP</strong>: Be prepared with well thought-out answers but avoid text-book answers!
</p>
<h3>
    Undirected questions
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Tell me a little bit about yourself.</li>
    <li>Tell me more about your past experience.</li>
    <li>What qualities should a successful XYZ possess?</li>
    <li>What do you know about our organization?</li>
    <li>How would you describe your ideal job?</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>TIP</strong>: Be aware of the tendency to become too relaxed and reveal information you didn't intend to share. Be friendly, but stay professional!
</p>
<h3>
    Stress questions
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Are you just shopping around or are you really interested in us?</li>
    <li>You don't seem to have any experience in this type of work.</li>
    <li>Why should I hire you?</li>
    <li>What interests you least about this job?</li>
    <li>What is the worst thing you have heard about our organization?</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>TIP</strong>: Be calm and project self-assurance!
</p>
<h3>
    Behavioural questions:
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Describe a time when you were faced with a stressful situation that demonstrated your coping skills.</li>
    <li>Give me a specific example of a time when you sold someone on an idea or concept.</li>
    <li>Give me an example of a time when you tried to accomplish something and failed.</li>
    <li>Give me a specific occasion in which you conformed to a policy with which you did not agree.</li>
    <li>Describe the most significant or creative presentation that you have had to complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>TIP</strong>: Be specific. Do not bring in unessential details. Use the following technique:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>describe the situation</li>
    <li>discuss the actions you took</li>
    <li>relate the outcomes and specify what you learned from it.</li>
</ol>
<h3>
    Your turn for questions
</h3>
<p>
    At the end of the interview that moment always comes when the interviewer asks, “Do you have any questions?” How you respond will affect their evaluation of you, so be prepared to ask insightful questions about the organization.
</p>
<p>
    Generally, it is not a good idea to ask about pay or benefits or similar areas, since this tends to make you look primarily interested in what the organization can do for you. It is also not a good idea to have no questions – this can be taken as a sign that you are not interested or knowledgeable enough to generate them.
</p>
<p>
    If you really can't think of anything to ask, get out of the danger zone by coming up with a confident reply. For example, “No, I think you already answered everything I was going to ask.”
</p>
<p>
    Five good questions to ask your employer:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Can you describe a typical day in this job?</li>
    <li>What are the expectations of the person in this position?</li>
    <li>What is the first project for the incumbent to undertake?</li>
    <li>How is performance measured and reviewed?</li>
    <li>Where does this position fit in the organization?</li>
</ol>
<h2>
    General <strong>TIPS</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Look your best!</strong><br>
    First impressions are very important: dress appropriately, show enthusiasm and interest, maintain eye contact and shake hands with the employer.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Be prompt and professional!</strong><br>
    Find out beforehand where you have to go, how much time it takes to get there and the name of the person you are seeing.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Do your research!</strong><br>
    Learn about your employer before you arrive.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Ask questions!</strong><br>
    Create a list of possible questions to bring with you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Follow up!</strong><br>
    After your interview, send a thank-you letter outlining your interest in the position and your relevant skills. You may wish to mention something in the interview that was of interest to you or include any information you may have forgotten to bring up in the interview. If you do not hear from the employer within the specified time-frame, send a follow-up letter to indicate your continued interest in the position.

    Portfolio development
</h1>
<p>
    A career portfolio is a collection of documents, artifacts or materials which are representative of your academic, career, and personal development. It is a reflection of who you are, what you want to achieve in your career and personal development.
</p>
<p>
    Portfolios can:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Show your achievements</li>
    <li>Document the scope and quality of your experience and training</li>
    <li>Demonstrate your skills and abilities</li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Three types of portfolios
</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Comprehensive</strong><br>
        Complete collection of items which reflect all skills and achievements. No size or length limitations. Rarely if ever distributed or displayed. Use for your own benefit: select appropriate items from this collection to create a targeted portfolio.</li>
    <li><strong>Targeted</strong><br>
        Contains items relevant to specific employer or industry. Complete yet succinct - no more than 20 pages. May be loaned to employer before or after interview. May also be shown or presented to employer during interview.</li>
    <li><strong>Portfolio-resume hybrid</strong><br>
        Short - usually no more than four pages, including resume. Distributed widely. Given - not loaned - to employer. May be left with employer after interview or used as an application package.</li>
</ol>
<h2>
    How to create a portfolio
</h2>
<h3>
    Step 1: Self-assessment
</h3>
<p>
    Look at your skills, abilities and past experience to determine what you have to offer an employer. Once you know what you need to show prospective employers, you are ready to find artifacts that will illustrate your capabilities.
</p>
<p>
    Artifacts are what we call the materials that you add to your portfolio. Here are some general <strong>TIPS</strong> to help you choose your artifacts:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Only include something if you have a good reason to.</li>
    <li>Try looking through your artifacts and think – is this important?</li>
    <li>Think of skills you have that you want to illustrate – when have you used them and how?</li>
    <li>What have you done that you are really proud of?</li>
    <li>Think like an employer – what would they want to see?</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Since you have limited space in your portfolio, you need to know why you are including something. Be sure to choose carefully. For each artifact, include a memo that explains its importance. You may also want to include a short personal anecdote that elaborates on or gives more significance to the artifact. If you choose to make a professional portfolio, these memos will explain your artifacts to whoever is looking at your portfolio.
</p>
<p>
    Examples of the type of information to include in your memo:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Name of activity/experience</li>
    <li>Main participants</li>
    <li>Date</li>
    <li>Describe what took place</li>
    <li>Why was it important? What did it represent?</li>
    <li>Challenges you faced and handled (if any)</li>
    <li>What changes/compromises did you have to make as you went along?</li>
    <li>What policy or procedure changes were made due to your input?</li>
    <li>Benefits or outcomes of the effort</li>
    <li>Were you given more responsibilities? Why?</li>
    <li>Were you promoted or given recognition?</li>
    <li>Skills used/developed (name at least 3)</li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Step 2: Portfolio content
</h3>
<p>
    Evidence of your accomplishments such as publications, writing samples (e.g. proposals or reports), PowerPoint presentations, a program/schedule/agenda from an event you’ve planned, critical paths or planning documents and examples of design/artwork can be included. To get started, here is a list of things you might want to include in your portfolio:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Table of contents</li>
    <li>Academic/personal information
        <ul>
            <li>résumé</li>
            <li>academic transcripts, degrees, diplomas or certificates</li>
            <li>fact sheet that details your hobbies and interests</li>
            <li>testing results</li>
            <li>list of references</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Skills/technical abilities
        <ul>
            <li>writing samples</li>
            <li>documentation of technical/computer skills</li>
            <li>evidence of capstone project</li>
            <li>performance evaluations</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Professional abilities
        <ul>
            <li>certification or licensure documents</li>
            <li>list of conferences and workshops attended</li>
            <li>letters of commendation/thanks for service</li>
            <li>internship or co-op summary report</li>
            <li>list of professional organization involvement</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Honours/award information
        <ul>
            <li>certificates of scholarships, research grants or other awards received</li>
            <li>nomination to honours/academic organizations</li>
            <li>newspaper articles about your achievements</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>
    Step 3: Portfolio design
</h3>
<p>
    A portfolio is usually presented in a zippered case, three ring binder or a multimedia format with print documents. Most importantly, organize and categorize your contents with a purpose in mind. Label the different sections of your portfolio to aid in identifying materials.
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Reverse chronological</strong><br>
        Graduate, Undergraduate (first year, second year, etc.), High School (if applicable). The most relevant materials should be placed near the front of your portfolio since the employer is most likely to see these materials first.</li>
    <li><strong>Functional</strong><br>
        Academic Experience, Internship Experience, Awards or Analytical, Communication, and Technical Skills.</li>
    <li><strong>Thematic</strong><br>
        For a theme such as "Business and Sustainability": Environmental Management Systems, Environmental Auditing, Sustainability Reporting.</li>
</ol>
<h2>
    Portfolio do’s:
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Design each section so that it is easy to scan – use sufficient white space and consistent font, style and spacing.</li>
    <li>Keep in mind that everyone’s portfolio is different. It is a reflection of yourself and should be as unique as you are.</li>
    <li>Remember to not feel discouraged because your portfolio isn’t done yet. It will never be truly finished and it will grow as you do.</li>
    <li>Update your portfolio as often as possible. It’s just as important to have an up-to-date portfolio as it is to have an updated résumé.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Portfolio don'ts:
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Have a large, unfocused collection of samples.</li>
    <li>Include marked up samples with grammatical or typographical errors.</li>
    <li>Don’t take anything to an interview that is too personal and/or inappropriate.</li>
    <li>Present someone else’s work as your own. Give the context of the sample as necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Incorporating your portfolio into an interview
</h2>
<p>Remember to always take your portfolio to an interview and try and respond to interviewer’s questions with portfolio examples where appropriate. There are two primary ways to incorporate your portfolio in an interview:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Directly refer to portfolio</strong>
        <p>
            Interviewer: Describe a team project you initiated and tell me about your role in the project.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            Student: During my last year in university, I joined a group of students interested in a community gardening project. After successfully approaching organizations and businesses for support, my role evolved into being the fundraiser for the group. Here is a newspaper photo of me accepting a cheque from one of our donors. By honing my interpersonal and presentation skills, I've generated more than $3,000 for this project.<br>
            &nbsp;
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Request permission to share portfolio</strong>
        <p>
            Interviewer: How would your former supervisors describe you?
        </p>
        <p>
            Student: Would you mind if I showed you a section of my portfolio to help answer that question?
        </p>
        <p>
            Interviewer: No...&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            Student: You commented earlier on the fast-paced nature of consulting and the need for effective prioritization. I'm proud of the fact that my last supervisor, as you'll note in this portion of the letter, praised me on remaining poised and professional under pressure and meeting the deadlines for three different projects in one week.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
