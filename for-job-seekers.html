    Career Planning
</h1>
<p>
    The first step in choosing a career path is to learn more about you! A career choice based on your values is likely to contribute to your overall job satisfaction. The career planning process consists of:
</p>
<h2>
    Step 1: Self-Assessment
</h2>
<p>
    It is important to find out about your work interests, styles and preferences. When you choose a career path, you are making a choice that will affect every aspect of your life. Your self-knowledge can help you make more informed and better decisions.
</p>
<p>
    Important questions to ask include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Interests: What are my likes and dislikes?</li>
    <li>Preferred Skills: What skills have I developed that I would like to use in a job?</li>
    <li>Personal Values: What kind of work will give me the most career satisfaction?</li>
    <li>Preferred Working Conditions: What type of environment would I like to work in?</li>
    <li>Physical Aspects: Do I have any physical aspects to consider when making a career choice?</li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Step 2: Research
</h2>
<p>
    The next step is to identify jobs which fit with your personal profile. Use the&nbsp;<a href="/resources/careers/for-job-seekers">resource library&nbsp;</a>to learn more about particular companies, organization, NGOs and governmental agencies you might want to work for. Talk to people in occupations that seem to match your personal profile to get a sense of the “real world” aspects of the job.

<h2>
    Step 3: Action
</h2>
<p>
    After researching your career options and finding out which occupation fits your personal profile, set your career goals and identify the steps required to achieve those goals. For example, consider that you might need to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>further your education or certification</li>
    <li>identify, research and contact potential employers</li>
