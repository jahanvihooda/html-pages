<h1>
    FES ListServ
</h1>
<p>
    The Faculty maintains seven main List Services (listservs). Three of these listservs are for official FES program postings, one strictly for alumni and three for general dialogue.<br><br> Membership in a listserv allows you to receive group mailings from other members of the listserv or from the listserv administrator. It is a great way to keep in touch with what is happening inside and outside of FES.<br><br> After you join a listserv it is a good idea to monitor the list for a while before posting a message yourself. This will allow you to see the type of topics that are discussed and it lets you get a general feel for how things work.
