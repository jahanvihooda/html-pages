<p>
    A field experience is essentially when you get academic credit for a structured work experience. Because you get credit for it, the field experience must be related to your Plan of Study and is subject to academic regulations.

<p>
    If you are interested in a field experience placement, you will need to:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Talk to your academic advisor to make sure it is appropriate</li>
    <li>Check with the Office of Student and Academic Services to make sure you meet all of the formal requirements and complete the necessary paperwork</li>
    <li>Find an appropriate placement by checking the FES Career Opportunities Board and networking with prospective employers/field experience supervisors</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Note: FES Career Services can help you search for potential opportunities, but does not arrange field placements for students
